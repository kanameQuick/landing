                    <h1 class="contentHeading">About Me</h1>
                    <p class="contentBody">Hi! I am Kaname Nohara, and I work as the CEO of WonderStars. I create some awesome stuff for myself and my friends. I do programming, arts, and electronics, as those are the things that made me interested. I am also the owner of a Roblox game called <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7226813029/V3-2D-Image-Roleplay">2D Image Roleplay</a>, which I made using the skills and resources that I have. I am currently on the hunt for someone (a girl), so if you are interested, feel free to contact me.</p>
                    <h1 class="contentHeading">Personality</h1>
                    <p class="contentBody">I am currently a shy boy, spending lots of my time looking for a special someone because a lot of people on the school campus already have one. I am quite afraid of being rejected when I ask a girl if she wants to be my "special someone", so it's up to you if you are interested in me or not. I am a helpful person, looking for people who need help with scripting their Roblox games. I am also currently working on a startup project my friend made, which is not yet finished. I also respect the boundaries of people and treat them with respect.</p>
                    <h1 class="contentHeading">As a Developer</h1>
                    <p class="contentBody">I started developing games on Roblox in 2018, when I saw another piece of software that came with Roblox called <i>Roblox Studio</i>. I went curious and tried it out, and I was looking for tutorials on how to use it. Once I got to the basics of using Studio, I made my first Roblox game called "Party4Noobs!" (which is now private) that uses a lot of free models because back then I didn't know how to build or even script.
                        <br><br>
                    Fast forward to around 2019, and I learnt how to do basic scripting in Lua thanks to the Roblox Developer Hub, which lets me know how every piece of Roblox scripting works and how to use it properly, then in 2020, I started how to build models on my own so that I won't rely on models that could potentially contain malicious code.</p>
                    <h1 class="contentHeading">WonderStars and 2D Image Roleplay</h1>
                    <p class="contentBody">
                        In August 2021, 'Team Teriffic' was founded by myself and began developing 2D Image Roleplay on that same date. I made the game because Custom Image Roleplay (a game that was popular at the time) does not allow anyone to use off-sale images, even if they actually own them. This raises serious privacy concerns among users alike, and I want to make a better alternative for that game, so I did so using all my skills and resources that I have.
                        <br><br>
                        2D Image Roleplay only had 2 features at the time: Votekick and the piece de r√©sistance, the Morph. A year later, once 2DIRP became noticed by a handful of people, it was updated to Version 2 with new features and possibilities, including chat customisation and props.
                        <br><br>
                        Along with the release of Version 2, Amburn, a proprietary anti-cheat engine used in 2D Image Roleplay, was created to deter and prevent various exploiting attempts from happening in the game. It has been maintained at this point to detect new methods of exploiting, and it has been used in another game called "Comedy World RP Fixed" by Baconify.
                        <br><br>
                        Later at this point, 'Team Teriffic' is now called what we know today as 'WonderStars', and later on, 2D Image Roleplay is now at its latest major release: Version 3, with more props, features, and the ability to use a 'Back Image'.
                        <br><br>
                        After these years, 2D Image Roleplay has gained a lot of visits from players in certain fandoms, enjoying their lives roleplaying as their favourite characters, and it has become one of the fun and safer alternatives to Custom Image Roleplay that is available in Roblox.
